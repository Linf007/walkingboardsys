Considering the need for real-time observation of the walkingboard status during the tension release process of power transmission lines, manual observation proves to be unsafe and inefficient. 
To address this issue, a walkingboard status monitoring system based on LoRa wireless transmission is proposed as a substitute for manual observation. 
The system comprises a data acquisition system, wireless communication transmission system, and monitoring and alert center. 
Using the STM32F103RCT6 chip, various sensor data is collected, and an improved LoRa networking mode is employed to achieve long-distance wireless communication. 
Processed data is then uploaded to the monitoring and alert center, enabling real-time monitoring of walkingboard status during the tension release process. 
Testing has validated the effectiveness and safety of the walkingboard status monitoring system.
